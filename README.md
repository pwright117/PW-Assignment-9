# Assignment-9

A couple bugs that I worked out were having previous just keep going further into the negatives, so if the array goes into negative, then
it just equals -1, that way, if you click the next button it will go to the 1st media rather than the second. Then, if pressing play
I added an if so that it will play the first one if it is -1, or continue where it left off if not.
I did the same thing with next so that it wouldn't keep going through to infinity, but just display nothing and still be able to play
the last song if going back.
